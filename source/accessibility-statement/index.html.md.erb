# Accessibility statement for GOV.UK Verify technical documentation

This accessibility statement applies to the GOV.UK Verify technical documentation at [https://www.docs.verify.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-verify-technical-documentation](https://www.docs.verify.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-verify-technical-documentation).

This website is run by the GOV.UK Verify team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

+ change colours, contrast levels and fonts
+ zoom in up to 300% without problems
+ navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

GDS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non compliance with the accessibility regulations

There are some images which contain text, and a text-only alternative is not available. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion [1.4.5 (images of text)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text).

The colour contrast ratio for some of the images is less than 3:1. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion [1.4.11 (non-text contrast)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-contrast).

There are parts of this documentation that are not accessible because of [issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/accessibility/#using-the-technical-documentation-template-for-your-own-documentation).

## How we tested this website

We last tested this website for accessibility issues in August 2020.

We used manual and automated tests to look for issues such as:

- lack of keyboard accessibility
- link text that’s not descriptive
- non-unique or non-hierarchical headings
- italics, bold or block capital formatting
- inaccessible formatting in general
- inaccessible language
- inaccessible diagrams or images
- lack of colour contrast for text, important graphics and controls
- images not having meaningful alt text
- problems when using assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We plan to fix the accessibility issues in the content by the end of March 2021.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

We plan to fix the issues with the Technical Documentation Template by the end of March 2021.

This statement was prepared on 21 September 2020. It was last updated on 22 January 2020.

This website was last tested in August 2020. The test was carried out by the technical writing team at GDS.

We tested a sample of pages from each section of the site.
