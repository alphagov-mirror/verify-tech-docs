<% if type == "encryption" %>

The e-mail from the GOV.UK Verify team confirms that GOV.UK Verify Hub is now using your new certificate to encrypt messages for your service. This means you can remove the old encryption key from your <%= component %> configuration.

<newline>

<%= warning_text('Wait for the deployment confirmation e-mail from the GOV.UK Verify Team before removing the old encryption key.') %>

  <% if component == "VSP" %>

    To remove the old encryption key from the <%= component %> configuration:

    1. Remove the key in `samlPrimaryEncryptionKey` and replace it with the key from `samlSecondaryEncryptionKey`.
    1. Leave `samlSecondaryEncryptionKey` empty for the next update.
    1. Restart the <%= component %> to implement the configuration changes.

  <% end %>


  <% if component == "MSA" %>

    Delete the old encryption key and certificate from your <%= component %>'s configuration.

    Remember to restart the <%= component %> to implement the configuration changes.

    While both old and new keys are in use, you may see error messages in the logs with the description `Unwrapping failed`. These messages appear because the MSA attempts to decrypt the SAML message using each key in turn. You can safely ignore these messages. However, do not ignore any other error messages related to SAML decryption.

  <% end %>

Once you've removed the old <%= type %> key, your <%= component %> only uses the new encryption key to decrypt messages from GOV.UK Verify Hub.

<% end %>


<% if component == "MSA" and type == "signing" %>

  Before deleting the old key and certificate make sure your service provider

  * you've received deployment confirmation from the GOV.UK Verify Team
  * your service provider is using your new MSA <%= type %> certificate

  If youâ€™re using the VSP, you can check its logs to confirm the VSP refreshed its metadata. Once it has loaded the new MSA metadata, the VSP is using your new MSA <%= type %> certificate to trust messages from your MSA.

  The e-mail from the GOV.UK Verify team confirms that GOV.UK Verify Hub is using your new MSA <%= type %> certificate to trust messages signed with your new <%= component %> signing key. This means you can replace the old signing key from your <%= component %> configuration.

  <%= warning_text('Make sure both your service provider and the GOV.UK Verify Hub are using the new signing certificate before deleting the old signing key.') %>

  To remove the old signing key from the MSA configuration:

  1. Delete the `signingKeys.primary` section.
  1. Rename `signingKeys.secondary` to `signingKeys.primary`. The MSA now signs the assertions with the new  key.
  1. Restart the MSA to update its metadata to contain only the new signing certificate.

  Your service provider now trusts assertions signed with your new <%= component %> signing key.

<% end %>
