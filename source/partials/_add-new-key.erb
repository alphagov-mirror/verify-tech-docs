<% if component == "VSP" %>
Add your new <%= component %> private encryption key to `samlSecondaryEncryptionKey` in the <%= component %> configuration file.

Restart the <%= component %> to implement the configuration changes. The <%= component %> can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.
<% end %>

<% if component == "MSA" and type == "encryption" %>

Add a second list item containing the details for your new key and self-signed certificate under `encryptionKeys` in your [MSA configuration][msa-config].

Remember to restart the MSA to implement the configuration changes.

For example:

```yaml
encryptionKeys:
- publicKey:
    certFile: msa_encryption_2016.crt
    name: MSA Encryption 2016
  privateKey:
    keyFile: msa_encryption_2016.pk8
- publicKey:
    certFile: msa_encryption_2017.crt
    name: MSA Encryption 2017
  privateKey:
    keyFile: msa_encryption_2017.pk8
```

| Field name | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `certFile` | The name of the `.crt` file containing your certificate                                                |
| `name`     | A meaningful name for your certificate which is published in your MSA's metadata |
| `keyFile`  |  The name of the `.pk8` file containing your private key                                                                                                |

Restart the MSA to implement the configuration changes. The MSA can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.

<% end %>


<% if component == "MSA" and type == "signing" %>

Add your new signing key and self-signed certificate to `signingKeys.secondary` in your MSA configuration.

Remember to restart the MSA to implement the configuration changes.

For example:

```yaml
signingKeys:
  primary:
    publicKey:
      certFile: msa_signing_2016.crt
      name: 2016 MSA Signing Key
    privateKey:
      keyFile: msa_signing_2016.pk8
  secondary:
    publicKey:
      certFile: msa_signing_2017.crt
      name: 2017 MSA Signing Key
    privateKey:
      keyFile: msa_signing_2017.pk8
```

| Field name | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `certFile` | The name of the `.crt` file containing your certificate                                                |
| `name`     | A meaningful name for your certificate which is published in your MSA's metadata |
| `keyFile`  |  The name of the `.pk8` file containing your private key                                                                                                |


Restarting the MSA publishes the new signing certificate to the MSA's metadata. The service provider youâ€™re using reads this metadata and uses the MSA's signing certificate to trust assertions signed by the MSA.

<% end %>


<% if component == "service provider" %>
Add your new service provider private encryption key to your service provider. Your service can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.
