## Request access to environments

To access the integration and production environments, fill in the
'Request access to an environment' form. Your GOV.UK Verify engagement
lead provides this form subject to successful gate reviews. You'll
access the integration environment during [Stage
4](http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage4/Stage4.html)
and the production environment during [Stage
5](http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage5/Stage5.html).

> **Note:** Please allow up to 5 working days for the GOV.UK Verify team to set up
> and configure access to an environment.

Before filling in the form, you must
[obtain signed certificates](#request-certificates) from the appropriate
certificate authority.

First select the environment you want to access: integration or production. 
If you're requesting access to the production environment, you need to fill 
in the entire form again as information from your integration environment 
will differ and is not carried over.

Guidance on whatâ€™s required by a service is in the form that will be shared by your engagement lead.
