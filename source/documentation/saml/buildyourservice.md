## Build your service


### Use extended validation certificates

You must use extended validation (EV) certificates for all public
interactions with your service. When you use EV certificates, the user's
web browser clearly indicates the name of the organisation they are
interacting with.

Using EV certificates is one of a range of measures to protect your
users from sites pretending to be you. See best practices for [using TLS
to protect
data](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/tls-external-facing-services)
from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

### SAML integration

#### Choose a product and framework

Your government service must be able to send SAML authentication
requests to, and receive SAML responses from, the GOV.UK Verify hub.

You can choose from a wide range of off-the-shelf products and
frameworks to integrate your service with GOV.UK Verify.

GOV.UK Verify has experience integrating and supporting services using
Shibboleth-SP (Service Provider) and OpenSAML libraries. This has worked
well for teams using Java. However, please use the most appropriate
products and frameworks for your team. See [Choosing
technology](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html)
in the Government Service Design Manual.

Contact your engagement lead if you need further information.

#### Configure and adapt your technology to respect the SAML profile

##### SAML metadata

The SAML metadata contains the
[SAML encryption and signing certificates](#data-encryption-and-signing) used
within the GOV.UK Verify federation. There are two sets of SAML
metadata.

##### Access the SAML metadata

1. **Federation metadata**

    Each environment has its own federation metadata.
   
    Access the federation metadata for the:
    * compliance tool by contacting your GOV.UK Verify engagement lead
    * integration environment at [https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation](https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation)
    * production environment at [https://www.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation](https://www.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation)

    The federation metadata is signed. It includes entity descriptors that define the roles of the GOV.UK Verify hub and the identity providers.

2. **Matching Service Adapter metadata**

    The Matching Service Adapter metadata is located in your Matching Service Adapter at /matching-service/SAML2/metadata

    This metadata is generated by your Matching Service Adapter and contains your Matching Service Adapter certificates. It includes an entity descriptor that defines the role of the Matching Service Adapter.on metadata

##### Handle responses using SAML metadata

Your service must be able to consume SAML responses that are issued by
the GOV.UK Verify hub. You must use the Matching Service Adapter
metadata to do this.

1. Validate the signature on the response. This checks that the response is correctly signed by the GOV.UK Verify hub (entityID: `https://signin.service.gov.uk`).

   You can use the hub X509 signing certificates contained in the
   federation metadata to validate this signature.

1. Decrypt the assertion.
1. Validate the signature on the assertion contained in the response. This assertion is generated and signed by your Matching Service Adapter.

    You can use the X509 signing certificate contained in the Matching
    Service Adapter metadata to validate this signature.

> **Caution:** Use this procedure with care. You must trust assertions signed by the
> Matching Service Adapter only. The GOV.Verify hub never issues
> assertions for consumption by the service endpoint, so make sure that
> itâ€™s *not* possible to trust the hub to issue assertions.
